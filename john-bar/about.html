            <p> I'm a new web developer whose intense interest in graphics, animations, and making the web browser interactive has led me to coding. I'm proficient in HTML5 and CSS. I keep up to date with all the additions to CSS and am in the middle of learning Javascript.</p>
            <p>I know Javascript but am making sure I have the fundamentals down pat before moving onto React, Vue, and other libraries within JS.</p>
            <p>In August 2020, I graduated from the University of South Carolina where I studied public relations and entrepenuership. Being self motivated and disciplined from a lifetime of high level soccer, has helped me use the down time of the pandemic to my advantage. I picked upskills like video editing, photoshop, InDesign and Blender. <br></p>
                 <p>A main focus of mine was, and is to find the best places to efficiently learn about current events in tech, finance, ecomm and more. I found that with the right timeline Twitter becomes an invaluable asset in developing a successful career. Studying those who have excelled at what you want to do is very helpful in navigating a new venture or even hobby.</p>
            <p> The goal learning these skills was to be able to create a fully integrated and interactive website that keeps the visitor wanting to come back. I aim to provide top class client services in helping them enter a new phase of the internet and prepare for web3.</p>
